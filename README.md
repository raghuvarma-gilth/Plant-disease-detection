Agriculture is one of the most essential sectors for sustaining human life, yet plant diseases continue to threaten global food security and farmer productivity. Millions of farmers worldwide face severe economic losses every year due to the late detection of plant diseases. Traditional disease identification relies on manual visual inspection by agricultural experts, which is often time-consuming, expensive, and prone to human error, especially across large farmlands.To address these challenges, this project presents an AI-driven Plant Disease Detection System based on Deep Learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The main goal is to automatically detect and classify plant leaf images as “healthy” or “diseased,” helping farmers take timely preventive measures. The system uses advanced image analysis techniques to ensure fast, accurate, and reliable disease identification without requiring specialized knowledge.The model is trained using the PlantVillage Dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images representing different plant species such as tomato, potato, apple, corn, grape, and pepper. Each species includes multiple disease categories like bacterial spot, leaf mold, late blight, mosaic virus, and healthy leaves. The dataset is preprocessed by resizing images, normalization, and applying data augmentation to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.A custom CNN architecture is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, consisting of convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. The model’s performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving a strong balance between training and validation accuracy.To make the system user-friendly, a Flask-based web application is developed, allowing users to upload plant leaf images for real-time disease prediction. The interface also provides natural treatment recommendations, such as Neem + Mandara extract for fungal infections or Turmeric spray for bacterial diseases, encouraging sustainable farming practices.
